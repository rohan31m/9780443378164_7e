Label 1 indicates the posterior root. Label 2 points to the spinal ganglion. Label 3 identifies the sympathetic trunk. Label 4 shows the ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. Label 5 indicates the spinal nerve. Label 6 points to the white ramus communicans. Label 7 identifies the gray ramus communicans. Label 8 shows the anterior root. Label 9 indicates the greater, lesser, and least thoracic splanchnic nerves. Label 10 points to the celiac ganglion. Label 11 identifies the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). Label 12 shows the intermediolateral cell column. Label 13 indicates the superior mesenteric ganglion. Label 14 points to the enteric plexuses. The sympathetic fibers, parasympathetic fibers, and afferent fibers to spinal cord or brain are indicated in the illustration. The preganglionic fibers of both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers, and afferent fibers are indicated by bold lines of different colors. The postganglionic fibers of both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers are indicated by dotted lines of different colors. Each fiber is marked with arrows to denote its pathway. The sympathetic fibers begin in the spinal cord and exit through the anterior root. They then pass through the white ramus communicans to reach a sympathetic ganglion. From there, the nerve signal takes different routes: upward or downward in the sympathetic trunk, or leaving directly through the gray ramus communicans to go back to the spinal nerves that supply blood vessels and skin. Other sympathetic fibers pass through the splanchnic nerves to reach collateral ganglia, where they connect to new neurons that go to internal organs such as the intestines. The parasympathetic fibers have preganglionic fibers that travel directly to small ganglia near the target organ. From these ganglia, short postganglionic fibers continue into the organ walls. The afferent fibers carry information from the organs and body tissues back to the spinal cord through the posterior root.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0002_157-199_B9780443378157000023.xhtml#f0100exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
