The L 4 dermatome runs along the inner side of the lower leg and ankle, ending at the inside of the foot and the big toe. The L 5 dermatome covers the outer part of the thigh, the front of the leg, the top of the foot, and the middle three toes. The S 1 dermatome supplies the outer side of the foot and the little toe. In the posterior view, the T 12 and L 1 dermatomes cover the lower back and upper buttock area. The L 2 and L 3 dermatomes continue down the back of the thigh. The L 4 dermatome appears along the inner side of the leg and knee region. The S 2 dermatome runs down the back of the thigh and the upper part of the calf.
