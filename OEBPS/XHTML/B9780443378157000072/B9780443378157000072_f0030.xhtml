				<p id="LD05">The anatomical illustration of the femur presents two views, namely the anterior view on the left and the posterior view on the right, with numbered labels. Labels 1 to 4 are marked on the anterior view and 8 to 10 in the posterior view; 5 to 7 are marked in both views. Label 1 indicates the greater trochanter. Label 2 points to the body or shaft of the femur. Label 3 shows the lateral epicondyle. Label 4 identifies the lateral condyle. Label 5 indicates the medial condyle. Label 6 points to the medial epicondyle. Label 7 shows the adductor tubercle. Label 8 identifies the linea aspera, which has a medial and lateral lip. Label 9 indicates the lesser trochanter. Label 10 points to the intertrochanteric crest. Label 11 shows the neck of the femur. Label 12 identifies the head of the femur. A key shows different lines of capsular and synovial membrane attachment. The line of attachment is represented by bold lines in different colors, and the line of reflection is marked by dotted line in different colors. The line of attachment of the border of the synovial membrane is marked along the area where the inner lining of the joint capsule ends on both ends. The line of reflection of the synovial membrane is marked over the neck of the femur. The line of attachment of the fibrous capsule is marked around the area where the strong outer layer of the joint capsule connects to the bone on both ends. The line of reflection of the unattached fibrous capsule is marked on the area where the capsule is not directly attached but forms a loose fold in the posterior view.</p>
