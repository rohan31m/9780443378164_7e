				<p id="LD011">The cross-section shows the blood vessels and muscle layers of the thoracic wall along with nearby nerve structures. 1 shows a small branch extending backward from the main intercostal artery to supply the muscles and skin of the back. 2 marks the main artery running between the ribs that supplies blood to the chest wall and overlying muscles. 3 represents a side branch from this artery that reaches the outer side of the chest to nourish the skin and muscles. 4 shows arteries running forward between the ribs to connect with the vessels on the front chest wall. 5 marks a vertical artery descending from the chest into the upper abdomen to supply the front abdominal wall. 6 shows the main artery running along the inner side of the chest beside the breastbone, giving off branches to the ribs and muscles. 7 represents the large main artery running down through the back of the chest, giving rise to the intercostal arteries. 8 indicates the cut ends of similar arteries on the right side between the ribs. 9 marks the sympathetic nerve chain running vertically beside the vertebral column, controlling involuntary chest and abdominal functions. 10, 11, and 12 show the three layers of intercostal muscles — innermost, internal, and external — that move the ribs during breathing. 13 represents the outermost muscle of the abdomen that helps in trunk movement and respiration.</p>
