				<p id="LD07">The illustration shows the muscles and nearby structures of the upper part of the esophagus. 1 shows the upper section of a muscle that helps close the lower part of the throat during swallowing, located just below the main throat muscles. 2 marks the lower ring-like portion of the same muscle that surrounds the top of the esophagus and acts as a sphincter to control food passage into it. 3 shows the beginning of the esophageal wall with a circular muscle layer and a few scattered outer fibers running lengthwise, aiding in the movement of food downward. 4 represents a thickened mass of longitudinal muscle fibers on the side of the esophagus that helps shorten and widen the tube during swallowing. 5 indicates the main circular muscle layer that wraps around the esophagus, producing wave-like contractions to move food to the stomach. 6 shows the left main bronchus lying close to the esophagus as it passes into the chest. 7 marks a ring-shaped cartilage at the lower part of the throat, forming part of the airway and sitting above the esophagus. 8 represents the larger shield-shaped cartilage above it that forms the front of the voice box.</p>
