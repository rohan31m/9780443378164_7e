The illustration shows the neck and upper chest's major nerves and nerve centers that control the heart, diaphragm, and nearby organs. 1 shows the uppermost swelling in the sympathetic chain on the side of the neck, which helps regulate heart rate and blood vessel tone. 2 marks a long cranial nerve descending from the brain through the neck and into the chest that controls voice, heart, and digestive functions. 3 represents the main nerve running downward on each side of the neck over the front of the chest, carrying signals to the diaphragm to control breathing. 4 shows small branches from the sympathetic chain that travel toward the heart to influence heartbeat and blood flow. 5 marks the network of intertwined nerves in front of the heart that coordinates nerve signals to the heart muscles. 6 again identifies the same breathing nerve, emphasizing its origin from neck spinal nerves C3, C4, and C5, which together maintain diaphragm movement. 7 shows a branch of the vagus nerve looping around a major chest artery and ascending toward the voice box, controlling muscles for speech. 8 indicates smaller branches from the vagus nerve within the chest that also reach the heart. 9 marks another swelling along the sympathetic chain in the mid-neck region that links to heart and lung control. 10 represents the main vagus nerve on the left side, continuing into the chest to supply the heart, lungs, and digestive organs.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0003_200-256_B9780443378157000035.xhtml#f0050exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
