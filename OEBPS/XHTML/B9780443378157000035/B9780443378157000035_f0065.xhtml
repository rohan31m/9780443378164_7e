				<p id="LD012">The illustration shows the upper chest and heart region with numbered parts from top to bottom. 1 On the right side of the neck, a large vertical vessel descends downward. 2 Just below it, this vessel joins another short one in the upper chest. 3 An artery and a vein lie close together beneath the collarbone. 4 These channels unite to form a large trunk entering the upper part of the heart. 5 Along the edge of the chest, a thin, shiny lining is seen. 6 Beneath it lies the outer membrane of the heart, cut open to reveal the surface beneath. 7 A small ear-shaped pouch projects from the upper right chamber of the heart. 8 Below this lies the main muscular chamber on the same side. 9 On the opposite side, another muscular chamber of the heart is visible. 10 Above it, a smaller pouch projects from the upper left chamber. 11 A short vessel runs horizontally toward the left lung. 12 From the front of the heart, a thick trunk arises and divides into two branches. 13 On the upper left side of the neck, a large vessel descends toward the chest. 14 Beside it, a major artery runs upward toward the head. 15 A large curved vessel arches over the top of the heart. 16 Two veins from the left side of the chest unite to form a wide single channel. 17 At the beginning of the arch, a thick branch extends upward toward the right side of the head and arm.</p>
