                <p id="LD022">The illustration shows the front view of the pericardial sac after the heart has been removed to reveal nearby major vessels and nerves. 1 marks the large vein returning blood from the upper body into the chest cavity. 2 shows the horizontal passage of the pericardial space lying behind the main arteries. 3 identifies the paired vessels that would carry blood from the right lung to the heart. 4 indicates the large vein entering from below that drains blood from the lower body. 5 highlights the pocket-like lower recess of the pericardial cavity. 6 marks the paired veins on the left side that would drain blood from the left lung. 7 shows the main vessel carrying blood from the heart to the lungs, lying at the upper center. 8 identifies a thin nerve with its small companion vessels running along the left side of the pericardial sac. 9 indicates the large artery ascending from the base of the heart. 10 traces the same thin nerve that descends from the neck to the diaphragm. 11 marks another nerve traveling downward near the heart’s surface to supply structures in the chest.</p>
