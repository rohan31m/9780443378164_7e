The illustration shows an anterior view of the right ventricle opened to reveal its inner structures and adjoining chambers. 1 marks the main valve between the right atrium and ventricle, with its thin flaps controlling blood flow into the chamber. 2 shows the delicate thread-like cords that attach the valve flaps to the inner heart wall. 3 identifies one of the cone-shaped muscles that anchor these cords, helping prevent the valve from inverting during contraction. 4 highlights the irregular muscular ridges forming the inner surface of the ventricle. 5 points to a special band of muscle running from the septum to the outer wall, carrying part of the heart’s conduction pathway. 6 marks the thick muscular wall dividing the two lower chambers of the heart. 7 shows the smooth, funnel-shaped upper part of the ventricle leading to the outflow tract. 8 identifies the valve at the entrance to the main artery leading to the lungs, with its three thin flaps that open and close during blood ejection. 9 marks the large artery carrying blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. 10 indicates the main upward vessel transporting blood from the left ventricle to the body. 11 shows the large vein returning blood from the upper body into the right atrium. 12 identifies the small ear-like extension projecting from the upper part of the right atrium, and 13 marks the right atrium itself, which receives blood before it passes into the ventricle.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0003_200-256_B9780443378157000035.xhtml#f0125exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
