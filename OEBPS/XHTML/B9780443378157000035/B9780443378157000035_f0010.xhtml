The anterior view of the human rib cage depicts the bony and cartilaginous structures that form the thoracic cavity. 1 is a large flat triangular bone at the upper back that forms the shoulder. It has a raised ridge forming the tip of the shoulder, a small hook-like part projecting forward, and a shallow, round surface on the outer edge that helps form the shoulder joint. 2 is a long curved bone across the top of the chest that links the shoulder area to the chest bone in the center. 3 includes the first seven pairs of curved ribs that attach directly to the chest bone through short, flexible strips of tissue. 4 represents these flexible strips that connect the front ends of the ribs to the chest bone. 5 shows the next three rib pairs that attach indirectly by joining the strip of tissue from the rib above. 6 shows the last two shorter rib pairs that end freely at the back without front attachment. 7 marks the long flat chest bone in the center, featuring a small notch at the top, a broad upper part, an angled junction, a long middle portion, and a small pointed tip at the lower end. All these parts together form the strong bony framework of the upper chest.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0003_200-256_B9780443378157000035.xhtml#f0010exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
