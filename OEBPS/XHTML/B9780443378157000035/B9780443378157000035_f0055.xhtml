				<p id="LD010">The anterior illustration of the thorax and neck presents the autonomic nervous system structures, major vessels, and upper digestive tract. 1 shows a nerve running between the ribs in the upper thorax that carries motor and sensory signals to the chest wall. 2 marks a small swelling in the sympathetic chain in the third thoracic region where nerve fibers connect to internal organs. 3 represents the vertical chain of sympathetic nerves running along each side of the vertebral column, forming part of the autonomic nervous system. 4 shows a long branch from the thoracic sympathetic chain that descends toward the abdomen to supply abdominal organs. 5 marks a network of nerves and paired ganglia in the upper abdomen surrounding a major artery, which distributes nerve fibers to the stomach, liver, and intestines. 6 shows the front bundle of the vagus nerve passing through the diaphragm to reach abdominal organs. 7 represents the same type of long sympathetic branch on the left side, traveling downward to join the abdominal plexus. 8 indicates a dense network of nerves located in front of the heart that regulates heartbeat and vessel tone. 9 shows a branch of the vagus nerve looping around a major chest artery and ascending toward the voice box to control speech muscles. 10 marks the portion of the sympathetic chain running up through the neck beside the vertebral column. 11 represents the main vagus nerve descending through the neck and chest to reach thoracic and abdominal organs. 12 shows a lower swelling along the vagus nerve in the neck that contains sensory nerve cell bodies. 13 marks an upper swelling on the same nerve near its origin at the skull base.</p>
