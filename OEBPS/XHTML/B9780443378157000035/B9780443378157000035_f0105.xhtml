                <p id="LD020">The illustration depicts the inner surfaces of both lungs, with the right lung shown above and the left lung below. In the upper section, 1 marks a large vessel carrying blood to the right lung, while 2 indicates veins returning blood toward the heart. 3 points to the central opening region where major airways and vessels enter. 4 highlights the deep groove dividing the upper and lower lobes. 20 identifies the shallow surface mark formed by the windpipe, and 19 shows the curved impression left by the food pipe. 18 represents the branch of the main airway leading to the upper lobe, 17 denotes small lymph nodes near the lung root, and 16 indicates a lower vein returning blood to the heart. In the lower section, 6 shows the main blood vessel carrying blood to the left lung, while 7 points to the primary airway of the left lung. 8 traces the long groove made by the main body artery running behind the lung, and 9 follows the impression of the food pipe. 10 marks a tongue-like extension of the front margin, 11 a thin fold connecting the lung base, 12 and 13 highlight veins draining blood from the left lung, 14 outlines a shallow depression made by a large neck artery, and 15 indicates the pointed upper tip. Besides the thoracic framework, the right lung is shown with three the upper part representing the superior lobe, the central area as the middle lobe, and the lower region as the inferior lobe. On the left side, the lung is divided into two parts: the upper section for the superior lobe and the lower section for the inferior lobe. The right lung appears slightly broader, while the left lung is narrower.</p>
