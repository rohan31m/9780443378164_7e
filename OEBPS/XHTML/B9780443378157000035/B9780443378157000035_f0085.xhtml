                <p id="LD016">The anatomical illustration of the mammary gland presents the internal anatomy. 1 Beneath the chest covering lies a broad muscle forming the base of the breast. 2 Above it are clusters of soft gland lobules responsible for producing milk. 3 Each cluster connects to a small, widened space that serves as a temporary reservoir for milk. 4 From these spaces, narrow tubes run forward through the breast tissue toward the surface. 5 At the center, these tubes open through a small raised projection on the skin. 6 Surrounding this projection is a circular, darker area of skin. 7 Small, rounded glands are scattered within this darker area to keep the surface moist. 8 Fine fibrous bands run from the deep tissue to the skin, helping to support and maintain the overall shape of the breast.</p>
