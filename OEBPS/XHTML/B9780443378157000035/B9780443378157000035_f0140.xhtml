                <p id="LD027">The illustration shows a superior view of the central fibrous framework of the heart with its major valves and connective supports. 1 marks the valve leading from the right ventricle to the lungs, formed by three thin, half-moon-shaped flaps. 2 indicates the valve at the base of the body’s main artery, also made up of three curved leaflets that prevent blood from flowing backward. 3 shows the two-flap valve between the left atrium and ventricle, allowing one-way flow from the upper to the lower chamber. 4 highlights the tough fibrous ring that supports this left-sided valve. 5 identifies the small thickened area of connective tissue that links the right and left fibrous rings, strengthening the heart’s structural core. 6 marks a similar connection on the left side that ties the surrounding rings together. 7 points to the three-flap valve between the right atrium and ventricle, which prevents backflow during contraction. 8 identifies the thin section of the dividing wall between the upper and lower chambers, where the fibrous tissue merges with the heart’s muscular septum.</p>
