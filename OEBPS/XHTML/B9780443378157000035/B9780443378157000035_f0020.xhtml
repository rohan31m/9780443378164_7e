				<p id="LD03">The illustration shows the front view of the upper chest and lower neck region with key muscles, veins, and arteries labeled. 1 shows thin muscle layers between the ribs that run downward and forward, helping in breathing by lifting the rib cage. 2 is a large blue vessel running beneath the shoulder that carries blood from the arm back toward the heart. 3 shows a pair of major blood vessels, one artery and one vein, positioned beneath the collarbone, supplying and draining the upper chest and arm. 4 is a vertical blue vessel running along the side of the neck, returning blood from the head toward the chest. 5 is a broad, flat muscle covering the back of the neck and upper shoulder, helping move the shoulder and head. 6 is a smaller triangular muscle beneath the larger chest muscle, connecting the ribs to the shoulder area and aiding in lifting the ribs during breathing. 7 represents the upper portion of the central chest bone located between the collarbones. 8 shows the artery and paired veins running down along the inner surface of the chest beside the breastbone. 9 marks the continuation of these vessels into the upper abdominal wall, where they supply blood to the front lower chest and upper belly region.</p>
