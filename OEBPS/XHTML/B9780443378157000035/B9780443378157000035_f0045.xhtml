				<p id="LD08">The cross-section of the thoracic spine and rib presents the path of a typical spinal nerve. The illustration also shows the thoracic spinal nerve and its connections to the chest wall. 1 shows the front root emerging from the spinal cord that carries signals from the spinal cord to the body muscles. 2 marks the back root that carries sensory information from the body to the spinal cord. 3 represents the short mixed nerve formed where these two roots join before dividing into branches. 4 shows a small swelling along the sympathetic chain beside the spine, which helps regulate involuntary functions like blood vessel control. 5 is the large front branch extending along the space between the ribs, forming the intercostal nerve that supplies the chest muscles and skin. 6 marks the smaller back branch that runs toward the back muscles and skin. 7 shows a side branch that emerges from the intercostal nerve to supply sensation to the side of the chest wall. 8, 9, and 10 depict the three layers of muscles between the ribs. These are the innermost, internal, and external intercostal muscles. These assist in breathing by moving the ribs. 11 represents the front branch of the intercostal nerve that supplies the skin near the front of the chest.</p>
