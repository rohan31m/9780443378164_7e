                <p id="LD026">The illustration shows the interior of the left atrium and adjoining parts of the heart as viewed from the front. 1 marks the small ear-shaped pouch extending from the upper part of the left atrium. 2 indicates the main valve at the beginning of the body’s largest artery, with three thin flaps that open and close to control blood flow out of the heart. 3 shows the thick muscular portion of the wall dividing the two lower chambers. 4 highlights the thinner upper section of the same wall, composed mainly of connective tissue. 5 marks the large venous channel running along the back of the heart that collects blood from the heart muscle itself. 6 indicates the wide vessel bringing blood upward from the lower body to the right side of the heart. 7 identifies the left upper chamber that receives blood from the lungs. 8 points to a small flap-like structure on the wall between the two atria, a remnant from fetal circulation. 9 marks the large vessel carrying blood toward the right lung, while 10 shows the corresponding vessel leading to the left lung. 11 highlights the curved upper part of the body’s main artery, and 12 identifies a short fibrous band connecting this artery to the vessel of the lungs, representing another remnant from fetal development.</p>
