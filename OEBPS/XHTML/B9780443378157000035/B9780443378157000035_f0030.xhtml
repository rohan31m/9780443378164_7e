				<p id="LD05">The illustration shows the inner surface of the front chest wall with deep muscle layers and major blood vessels. 1 shows the deepest set of muscles lying between the ribs that assist with breathing by helping move the ribs during exhalation. 2 marks a thin sheet of muscle on the inside of the front chest wall that runs from the lower part of the breastbone to several ribs, helping pull the ribs downward. 3 is the small pointed lower tip of the central chest bone located where the chest meets the upper abdomen. 4 shows a flat muscle layer of the abdominal wall that lies deep inside and runs across the front and sides of the abdomen, helping support the abdominal organs. 5 marks the artery and its paired veins running vertically along the inner side of the front chest wall close to the breastbone, supplying blood to the ribs and chest muscles. 6 represents a major artery in the neck that carries blood from the heart to the head and neck region. 7 shows a large vein that collects blood from the head, neck, and upper limbs and directs it toward the heart.</p>
