Number 1 descends from the central trunk, while 2 arises as the first short branch near the top. Number 3 extends upward and to the right toward the liver region, and 4 appears as a smaller branch near the gallbladder area. Number 5 continues toward the middle of the liver, 6 runs along the upper curve of the stomach, and 7 descends toward the upper small intestine. Number 8 curves along the lower edge of the stomach, while 9 emerges near the center, linking the liver and stomach regions. Number 10 travels leftward along the stomach’s lower border, 11 consists of several tiny branches moving toward the upper stomach, 12 takes a winding path to the left side ending near the spleen, and 13 ascends along the top of the stomach toward its entrance.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0004_257-317_B9780443378157000047.xhtml#f0075exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
