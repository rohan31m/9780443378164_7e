				<p id="LD07">The illustration depicts the posterior abdominal wall. It highlights the muscular and tendinous structures that support the diaphragm and spine. 1 marks the broad muscle on the back wall running between the lower ribs and the hip crest. 2 shows the central fibrous portion of the diaphragm where its muscle fibers converge. 3 indicates the midline arch of the diaphragm over the main artery, while 4 shows the inner arch formed over the psoas muscle. 5 highlights the outer arch spanning across the quadratus lumborum muscle. 6 marks the smaller vertical muscle in front of the larger psoas, and 7 identifies the thick muscle running along the lumbar spine to the thigh. 8 points to the fan-shaped muscle lining the inner surface of the pelvis, and 9 shows the slender tendon of the smaller psoas muscle. 10 highlights the deep horizontal abdominal muscle that attaches to the back wall. 11 represents the small triangular weak area in the diaphragm near its costal attachment, and 12 identifies the strong fibrous band of the diaphragm that descends along the right side of the spine.</p>
