In the anterior view, 1 depicts a thin fold running along the upper surface. 2 shows the large right portion of the organ. 3 indicates the small pear-shaped sac beneath it. 14 marks a vertical fold separating the two main parts. 13 points to a rounded cord-like structure lying within that fold. 15 shows the smaller left portion of the liver. In the lower visceral view, 4 depicts a square-shaped area beside the small sac. 5 shows a short tubular structure descending from the lower margin. 6 represents a portion of the upper fold extending toward the kidney. 7 marks a smooth, uncovered area on the posterior surface. 8 shows a large vertical channel running upward through this area. 9 indicates a small posterior lobe adjacent to it. 10 points to a narrow fissure running obliquely along the back. 11 shows a small artery entering the portal region. 12 represents the central gateway area where major vessels and ducts converge.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0004_257-317_B9780443378157000047.xhtml#f0125exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
