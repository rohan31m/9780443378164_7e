In the upper section, number 1 marks a duct emerging from the liver region. Number 2 points to a short connecting duct just below it. Number 3 indicates the continuation of the bile passage moving downward. Number 4 shows the first part of the small intestine. Number 5 points to a cut portion of the large intestine running across. Number 16 represents a large digestive organ located nearby. Number 17 indicates a branching artery close to it, and number 15 marks a glandular organ situated behind. In the lower section, numbers 6, 7, and 8 represent successive parts of a small sac-like organ that stores bile. Number 9 points to a descending segment of the small intestine. Number 10 highlights the junction where two ducts unite before entering it. Numbers 11 and 12 mark the channels leading from the gland and liver region. Number 13 indicates two upper branches joining to form a main bile passage, while number 14 marks the twisted and smooth portions of a connecting duct.</p>
