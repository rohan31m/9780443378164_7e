				<p id="LD019">The illustration shows fifteen numbered veins forming the network of the portal venous system, which drains blood from the digestive organs to the liver. Number 1 appears around the region near the navel, representing small connecting veins linking surface veins to deeper abdominal vessels. Number 2 is located along the inner curve of the stomach, draining toward a large central vein shown as number 3, which carries nutrient-rich blood to the liver. Number 4 is a large vertical vessel in the mid-abdomen that collects blood from the intestines. Numbers 5, 6, and 7 branch laterally from this main trunk, showing veins coming from the transverse colon, right colon, and ileocecal junction. Numbers 8 to 10 appear near the lower portion of the diagram, representing small veins draining the rectal region—one pair lower down, another set in the middle, and a third group higher up. Numbers 11 and 12 are seen on the left side, showing vessels that drain the descending and sigmoid colon and unite to join the splenic region. Number 13 runs horizontally across the upper abdomen, collecting blood from the spleen before joining the central trunk. Number 14 follows the upper curve of the stomach, while number 15 extends upward from the lower esophagus, showing venous channels that connect the abdominal and thoracic systems.</p>
