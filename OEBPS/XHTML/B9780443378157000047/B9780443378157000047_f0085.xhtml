				<p id="LD016">The illustration depicts fifteen numbered arteries branching from the abdominal aorta and its extensions. The number 1 artery appears near the top, supplying the diaphragm. Number 2 is a short trunk dividing into three main branches that supply the liver, stomach, and spleen. Number 3 arises slightly below, extending laterally toward a small gland above the kidney. Number 4 branches horizontally to supply the kidney, while 5 represents four smaller paired arteries running backward toward the spine. Number 6 marks the bifurcation of the main vessel into two large branches leading to the lower limbs. Number 7 runs downward into the pelvic cavity, and 8 continues forward beneath the inguinal region. Number 9 is a smaller branch extending upward along the inner abdominal wall. Number 10 again supplies the pelvic region, and 11 is a thin vertical artery descending along the midline of the sacrum. Number 12 lies above the bifurcation, curving toward the left side of the lower colon. Number 13 forms the main descending trunk through the abdomen. Number 14 consists of slender paired arteries extending toward the gonadal organs, and 15 emerges just below the upper branches, supplying the mid-intestinal area.</p>
