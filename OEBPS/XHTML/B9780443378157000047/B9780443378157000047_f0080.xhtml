Number 1 emerges as a large central branch from the aorta supplying the midgut, while 2 extends horizontally toward the transverse colon region. Number 3 forms small straight branches reaching the intestinal wall, and 4 outlines a continuous vessel running along the inner border of the colon. Number 5 extends toward the right colon area, and 6 branches downward toward the junction of the small and large intestines, giving rise to smaller side branches. Number 7 extends toward a small, narrow pouch at the lower right abdomen. Number 8 runs downward in the lower pelvis toward the rectal region, while 9 again shows fine, straight arterial branches along the intestinal loops. Number 10 appears as a fold of tissue holding several vessels together, and 11 forms multiple curved branches running toward the lower left colon. Number 12 extends upward along the left side of the colon, and 13 arises lower on the aorta, supplying the hindgut. Number 14 includes several parallel arteries feeding the small intestine, and 15 is a thin mesenteric fold supporting the transverse portion of the colon.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0004_257-317_B9780443378157000047.xhtml#f0080exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
