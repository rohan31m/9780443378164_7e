Running beneath it, 2 a major arterial branch enclosed in a thin peritoneal fold is visible. Near this area, 3 a slender instrument is passed through the natural opening that connects the greater and lesser sacs of the peritoneum. Below that, 4 the small pear-shaped bile reservoir is seen close to 6 the descending portion of the first part of the small intestine. Behind these digestive organs lies 5 a bean-shaped organ positioned along the back wall of the abdomen, and adjacent to it, 7 the rounded head of a glandular structure also located in the same region. A connective membrane, 8, stretches horizontally across, supporting the upper section of the large intestine. Toward the upper left, 9, the sharp bend of the colon appears near 10, a soft, dark organ of blood filtration. Just above, 11, a small triangular endocrine structure rests close to the upper kidney pole, and 12, a slender blood vessel runs nearby along the underside of the diaphragm.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0004_257-317_B9780443378157000047.xhtml#f0110exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
