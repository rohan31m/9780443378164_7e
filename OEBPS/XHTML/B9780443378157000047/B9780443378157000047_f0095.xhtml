Number 1 lies near the upper surface of the diaphragm, showing small paired vessels collecting blood from that region. Number 2 represents the main vertical venous trunk that carries deoxygenated blood to the heart. Number 3 is seen branching horizontally from this trunk toward the right kidney. Numbers 4 and 10 trace multiple paired veins extending from the posterior abdominal wall, connecting upward along the vertebral column. Number 5 indicates the merging point of the large pelvic veins forming the lower section of the main trunk. Number 6 shows a small midline vein at the lower end of the spine, while numbers 7 and 8 represent the outer and inner pelvic veins draining the lower limbs and pelvic organs. Number 9 shows their convergence to form the common venous trunk on each side. Number 11 depicts slender paired vessels running from the reproductive organs toward the main abdominal vein. Number 12 is found near the upper left abdomen, showing a small vein from the adrenal gland connecting with a vessel from the diaphragm. Finally, number 13 lies near the top of the illustration, marking three short veins entering the main trunk from the liver.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0004_257-317_B9780443378157000047.xhtml#f0095exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
