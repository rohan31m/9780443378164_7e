				<p id="LD017">The illustration presents sixteen numbered abdominal structures focusing on the major blood vessels and nearby organs. Number 1 appears near the upper right kidney as a small triangular gland. Number 2 and 3 show two arterial branches supplying that gland from the nearby large vessels. Number 4 lies at the upper midline, representing a tubular passage descending toward the stomach. Number 5 and 6 are paired vessels located near the diaphragm on the left, with one carrying blood upward and the other supplying oxygenated blood to the diaphragm. Number 7 marks a short, thick arterial trunk that divides into three main branches supplying the upper abdominal organs. Number 8 indicates a small vessel descending from the trunk toward the left adrenal region, while 9 shows a single vein draining the same area. Number 10 consists of a slender paired artery and vein running down toward the gonadal organs. Number 11 and 12, located in the middle of the image, represent two major abdominal arteries that have been cut, supplying the intestines. Number 13 forms the central vertical artery running through the abdomen, and 14 lies parallel beside it, carrying venous return upward. Number 15 displays paired vessels extending laterally toward the right kidney, while number 16 represents a thin tubular structure descending from the kidney toward the urinary bladder.</p>
