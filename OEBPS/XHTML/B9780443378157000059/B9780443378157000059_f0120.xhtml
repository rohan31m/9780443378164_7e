				<p id="LD023">The detailed anatomical illustration of the female perineum shows numbered structures 1 to 14 arranged around the external genital and pelvic floor region. Number 1 indicates a small cylindrical organ located anteriorly at the upper margin of the vestibule. Number 2 depicts a paired superficial muscle extending on each side of the vaginal opening. Number 3 shows a fibrous membrane forming the deep boundary of the superficial perineal pouch. Number 4 identifies a prominent bony projection on the lateral side serving as a muscular attachment point. Number 5 marks a strong ligament running obliquely from the sacrum to the same bony prominence. Number 6 highlights a wedge-shaped, fat-filled space situated lateral to the anal canal. Number 7 represents a muscular canal positioned centrally in the lower pelvis. Number 8 shows a dense fibromuscular node located between the openings of the vagina and anus. Number 9 depicts a narrow muscle band running transversely across the posterior part of the perineum. Number 10 corresponds to a small gland situated near the vaginal opening, partly covered by muscle. Number 11 identifies an elongated erectile structure on each side of the vaginal orifice. Number 12 indicates an oblique muscle surrounding the lateral sides of the erectile tissue of the vestibule. Number 13 shows a small external opening situated anterior to the vaginal orifice. Finally, number 14 represents a delicate fibrous band anchoring the small anterior erectile organ to the underlying tissues.</p>
