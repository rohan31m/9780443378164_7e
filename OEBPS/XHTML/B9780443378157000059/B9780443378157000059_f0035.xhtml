				<p id="LD06">The illustration presents a deep dissection of the female perineum, showing the network of vessels, nerves, and muscles encircling the urethra and vaginal orifice. 1 depicts a pair of small vessels running along the top of the clitoral body that drain and supply blood to it. 2 indicates the fine sensory nerve lying beside these vessels, responsible for transmitting touch sensations from the clitoris. 3 shows a muscle band arching around the urethra, contributing to its compression. 4 represents a key artery of the perineum running laterally to supply deeper perineal structures. 5 shows its companion nerve, providing motor and sensory innervation to the perineal muscles. 6 indicates a horizontally placed muscle extending between both sides of the perineal membrane, helping stabilize the pelvic floor. 7 shows a circular muscle surrounding both the urethra and the vagina, functioning as a voluntary sphincter. 8 depicts the opening of the vaginal canal located posteriorly in the perineum. 9 marks the muscle directly encircling the urethra, forming part of the external sphincter mechanism. 10 indicates the small external opening of the urethra lying anterior to the vaginal entrance.</p>
