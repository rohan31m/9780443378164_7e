				<p id="LD019">The superior anatomical illustration of the female pelvis is divided into central, lateral, and posterior regions, containing fourteen numbered structures. Number 1 is placed at the dome-shaped organ located centrally in the upper pelvis. Number 2 lies just to the side, marking a small oval body attached near the upper margin. Number 3 appears as a narrow curved tube extending from the central organ toward the oval structure. Number 4 points to a fine cord-like band running forward and downward from the same area. Number 5 covers a wide membranous sheet spreading across the pelvic cavity to support nearby organs. Number 6 identifies major vessels situated along the pelvic wall on one side. Numbers 7 and 8 indicate loops of the large intestine on the left, with Number 7 higher and Number 8 continuing below it. Number 9 marks a corresponding intestinal section on the right. Number 10 shows a thin fold running backward along the pelvic wall. Number 11 is seen at the upper lateral side, enclosing a vessel bundle within a slender fold. Number 12 points to a vertical tubular structure descending along the midline posteriorly. Number 13 indicates a deep pouch-like depression between the digestive and reproductive organs. Number 14 lies at the lower front part of the illustration, showing a rounded sac-like structure related to urinary function.</p>
