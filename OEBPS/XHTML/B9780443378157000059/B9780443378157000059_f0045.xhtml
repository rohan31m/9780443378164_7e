				<p id="LD08">The illustration shows a median section of the male pelvis and penis, displaying the internal passage of the urethra and its associated structures. 1 depicts a circular smooth muscle at the bladder outlet that controls urine flow. 2 shows the gland surrounding the upper urethra that produces prostatic fluid. 3 indicates a small pouch-like remnant within the prostate. 4 marks the tiny openings through which seminal fluid from paired ducts enters the urethra. 5 shows the small paired glands at the base of the penis with ducts opening into the urethra, contributing to lubrication during arousal. 6 depicts the voluntary muscle encircling the membranous urethra that allows conscious control of urination. 7 indicates the enlarged posterior part of the spongy urethra enclosed within erectile tissue at the penis base. 8 shows the root portions of the erectile bodies anchored to the pelvis. 9 represents the paired cylindrical tissues that fill with blood during erection. 10 depicts the tough fibrous covering surrounding the erectile bodies. 11 shows the single midline erectile tissue encasing the urethra along the shaft. 12 marks the rounded tip forming the head of the penis. 13 indicates the terminal opening where urine and semen exit.</p>
