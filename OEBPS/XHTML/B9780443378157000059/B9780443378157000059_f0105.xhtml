				<p id="LD020">The illustration presents a lateral view of the female reproductive system, showing numbered structures from 1 to 13. Number 1 marks the dome-shaped upper part of the central organ. Number 2 points to a short band connecting this organ to an oval structure nearby. Number 3 lies in a thin fold stretching around the tubular part above, while number 4 extends outward as a cord-like fold that carries vessels toward the oval structure at number 5. Number 6 is the main portion of the central organ below its rounded top. Number 7 occupies the broader lower fold that supports this organ laterally. Number 8 runs as a narrow tube crossing close to the base of the fold. Number 9 lies posteriorly as a fibrous band extending toward the lower pelvic wall. Numbers 10 to 13 trace the curved tube leading from the central organ to the oval structure-beginning with finger-like projections at 10, the funnel-shaped end at 11, the widened mid-portion at 12, and the narrow segment joining the main organ at 13.</p>
