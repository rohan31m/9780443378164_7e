The upper section shows the posterior view, highlighting the strong supporting bands and openings behind the pelvic bones. 1 depicts the ligament connecting the lower spine to the pelvis. 2 shows the cord-like band running along the tips of the spine’s projections. 3 represents the tough fibrous sheets uniting the sacrum and hip bones behind the pelvis. 4 depicts the large opening through which nerves and vessels pass out of the pelvis. 5 shows the broad band extending from the sacrum to the sitting bone, helping stabilize the pelvis. 7 represents the fibrous extensions connecting the sacrum and tailbone. The lower section shows the anterior view, displaying the pelvic brim and its front connections. 6 depicts the vertical band running along the front of the spine that helps prevent overextension. 8 represents the inner hollow of the hip bone. 9 shows the upper curved ridge of the hip. 10 depicts the ligament binding the front of the sacrum to the hip bone. 11 represents the prominent front tip of the hip bone. 12 shows the short ligament running from the sacrum to a small pointed projection near the pelvic outlet. 13 depicts the smaller opening beneath the larger posterior one. 14 represents the upper bar of bone forming the front part of the pelvis. 15 shows the small forward bump near the midline. 16 depicts the central joint uniting the two pubic bones.</p>
