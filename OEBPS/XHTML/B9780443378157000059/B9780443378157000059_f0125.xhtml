Number 1 shows a tubular structure enclosed in a peritoneal fold extending downward from the pelvic wall. Number 2 marks an oval opening located above the inguinal ligament through which a major cord structure enters the abdomen. Number 3 indicates paired vessels descending within a peritoneal fold toward the lower pelvis. Number 4 highlights a large vascular pair partially covered by peritoneum in the posterior pelvic wall. Number 5 represents a segment of the large intestine on the left side of the abdomen. Number 6 shows the S-shaped continuation of the large intestine curving toward the midline. Number 7 points again to the same slender paired vessels as they course toward the lower scrotal region. Number 8 depicts a narrow muscular tube running inferiorly, crossing the vessels and approaching the urinary bladder. Number 9 identifies a shallow recess located on either side of the rectum. Number 10 shows the initial segment of the large intestine situated in the right lower quadrant. Number 11 represents a peritoneal fold extending between the rectum and urinary bladder. Number 12 highlights a deep peritoneal space formed between those two organs. Number 13 depicts a hollow muscular organ at the center of the pelvis with an overlying transverse fold. Number 14 marks a midline fibrous band ascending from the apex of that organ toward the umbilicus. Finally, number 15 shows the terminal part of the large intestine descending posteriorly within the pelvis.</p><p class="image-right_back"><a role="doc-backlink" href="CH0005_318-374_B9780443378157000059.xhtml#f0125exlink">Navigate back to </a></p></div></section></body></html>
