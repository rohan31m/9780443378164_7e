				<p id="LD021">The sagittal anatomical illustration demonstrates numbered pelvic structures from 1 to 14, showing the spatial relationships of ligaments, vessels, and fascia within the female pelvis. Number 1 indicates a midline fibrous band extending from the bladder apex toward the umbilicus. Number 2 lies laterally as a paired fibrous ridge on each side of the midline fold. Number 3 corresponds to a hollow muscular organ at the anterior pelvic region surrounded by connective fascia. Number 4 marks an oval opening in the lower abdominal wall associated with a passageway for vessels and ligaments. Number 5 traces a cord-like band extending from the uterus toward the anterior abdominal wall. Number 6 follows a vascular bundle running within a fold that suspends the oval reproductive organ above. Number 7 identifies the lower cylindrical portion of the central reproductive organ enclosed in fascia. Number 8 is positioned posteriorly as the terminal part of the digestive tract enclosed by its fascial covering. Number 9 outlines a potential space between the posterior vaginal wall and the anterior rectal wall, located inferior to the deeper pelvic pouch. Number 10 shows a dense connective band extending laterally from the cervix to the pelvic wall. Number 11 points to another strong fibrous structure running posteriorly from the uterus toward the sacrum. Number 12 identifies a retropubic space located between the pubic bone and the bladder. Number 13 represents a prominent venous channel located superior to the external genital structure. Finally, number 14 denotes the midline cartilaginous joint uniting the two pubic bones anteriorly.</p>
